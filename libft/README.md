# 42_Libft

This is the first project of the course and is a library we can use in a lot of future projects!
It as a lot of simple but usefull functions from a simple isalpha to a split and atoi.
It was perfect to kick start our basics in C.
The extra folder as some function which were not part of the original project but I had later
to make my life easier like my version of prinft() that was the next project.
